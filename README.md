# Wine-Market-Analysis
***

## Task
The problem is to retrieve and analyze of wine data from the Vivino API, 
including wine reviews, wine details, and various statistics related to the wines.

The challenges include:
‚Ä¢	Making HTTP requests to the Vivino API and handling the API responses.
‚Ä¢	Extracting relevant data from the JSON responses.
‚Ä¢	Collecting wine reviews for multiple wines, each potentially spanning multiple pages.
‚Ä¢	Merging and structuring the collected data into DataFrames for analysis.
‚Ä¢	Performing data analysis and visualization tasks to gain insights from the collected data.
‚Ä¢	Implementing linear regression for predicting wine ratings.

## Description
The multifaceted problem was tackled systematically:
‚Ä¢	Fetching Wine Data: We accessed the Vivino API using Python's requests library and 
    carefully crafted URL parameters to retrieve relevant wine information.
‚Ä¢	Data Preprocessing: We meticulously cleaned and structured the data, addressing 
    missing values and ensuring its readiness for analysis.
‚Ä¢	Visualization: Through matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly Express, we crafted captivating 
    visualizations that reveal patterns and insights within the data.
‚Ä¢	Machine Learning: The scikit-learn library enabled us to create a linear regression model 
    for predicting wine ratings, leveraging machine learning techniques to unlock the power of data.


## Installation
The Python code provided in this project does not require installation in the traditional sense, 
here's how you can get started:
‚Ä¢	Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
‚Ä¢	Install the required Python libraries using pip, if not already installed. You can use; 

                pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn 


## Usage
‚Ä¢	Run the Python script in your preferred development environment or IDE.
‚Ä¢	Follow the code comments and documentation to understand each section's purpose and execution.
‚Ä¢	Experiment with the code by making modifications or applying it to your own wine dataset.

Whether you're an aspiring data scientist or a wine aficionado, this code invites you to explore, 
analyze, and discover the secrets of the vine. 

Cheers to the blend of data and wine! üç∑üêç
